<h2>Archipelago</h2>
https://archipelago.gg/ is a tool for generating multiworld randomizers.<br/>
A YAML describes the rules for what gets randomized in a given game for a given player.
<h2>Purpose</h2>
This project was created to make several coppies of a YAML for Centipelago challenges, where one player completes a multiworld containing 100 coppies of the same YAML.<br/>
This project was made to remove the tedium from manually changing the players name and filename for each YAML copy.
<h2>Future Plans</h2>
While right now this tool can only generate YAMLs, in the future I want it to be able to act as a graphic display for Centipelagos, so users can for instance see how many macguffins each world has.
<h2>Naming</h2>
PT stands for Pizza Tower since that was the first use case. Specifically named after the Piraneapple enemy.
